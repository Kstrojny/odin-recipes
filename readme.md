Hello,
This is my first Odin project where I will be creating a website with recipes
Before this project I already started making my own website about my hobbies
However
Many beginners have included their beginners codes and done some fun things with this
recipe project so I look forward to learning from them as well

I am comfortable with setting up index, page and images but am still new to
knowing how to use GIT and will be focussing my notes on that aspect of the project.
